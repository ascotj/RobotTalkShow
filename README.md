Notes:

-If your device falls asleep after the loading screen, then go to Setting > Sleep and change Sleep setting to 2 minutes.
(If this happens close out the app and start over.)

-If your computer screen looks too bright or catches too much glare the app sometimes does not work correctly.

-If the computer screen appears out of focus you can tap on the touch screen to bring up the focus menu.
